# Web-Scraper

This web-scraper was a fun project to try out web-scraping for my self.

The program i have written will scrape information such as name, IDnr, price, bottle, volume, bitterness, fullness, sweetness, kind, info, color, 
producer and alcohol content of the beer automatically, provided a link to systembolagets website. It surpasses the age restriction and loads in the beers using 
selenium and stores the data in a dataframe using pandas.
After a bit of cleaning i stored the data in a database i created in sql.

If you just want to play around with the data you can dowload the csv file "Systemet_Ã–l.csv" containing information about 399 different beers.

OBS!
The text data will be in swedish since systembolaget is only operating in Sweden.
